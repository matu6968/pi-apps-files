# pi-apps-files

If an app passes from the [Pi-Apps](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps) app submission issue created by me, then the precompiled files will be uploaded here and used by scripts which will be downloaded from this repository.
Files are found in the github release which allows it to store large files: https://github.com/matu668/pi-apps-files/releases/tag/large-files
